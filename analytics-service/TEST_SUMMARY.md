# Analytics Service - Test Summary

## Test Results

✅ All tests passing (10 tests)

### Test Coverage

#### 1. Worker Thread Tests (`__tests__/workers/aggregator.test.ts`)
- ✅ Aggregates seller metrics from ProductCreated events
- ✅ Aggregates category metrics
- ✅ Tracks low stock products (quantity < 10)
- ✅ Handles ProductUpdated events with price/quantity changes
- ✅ Handles ProductDeleted events

#### 2. DynamoDB Storage Tests (`__tests__/storage/dynamodb.test.ts`)
- ✅ Saves seller metrics with TTL
- ✅ Saves category metrics with TTL
- ✅ Saves low stock metrics
- ✅ Saves all metrics in parallel

#### 3. S3 Archive Tests (`__tests__/storage/s3.test.ts`)
- ✅ Archives metrics to S3 in JSON format

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Worker Threads
- CPU-intensive aggregation runs in separate thread
- Non-blocking event processing
- Timeout protection (30s)
- Error isolation

### Retry Policy
- 10 retries with exponential backoff
- Initial delay: 2000ms
- Backoff multiplier: 2x
- Max delay: 60000ms
- Matches event-contracts.json specification

### Metrics Calculation
1. **Seller Metrics**
   - Total products per seller
   - Active vs deleted product counts
   - Total inventory value

2. **Category Metrics**
   - Total products per category
   - Total value per category
   - Average price calculation

3. **Low Stock Metrics**
   - Products with quantity < 10
   - Count and detailed list

### Storage Strategy
- **Hot Storage**: DynamoDB with 30-day TTL
- **Cold Storage**: S3 daily archives
- **Parallel Writes**: Non-blocking storage operations

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Event Generation

Use `test-event.js` to send sample events:

```bash
node test-event.js
```

This sends:
- ProductCreated events (2 products, different sellers)
- ProductUpdated event (price and quantity changes)

## Architecture Validation

✅ Kafka consumer for 3 topics (created, updated, deleted)
✅ Worker Thread for CPU-intensive calculations
✅ DynamoDB hot storage with TTL
✅ S3 cold storage with daily batches
✅ Retry policy implementation
✅ Metrics calculation as specified
✅ TypeScript implementation
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Graceful shutdown
