# AI Prompt 003: Architecture Diagram Design and Iterations

## Metadata
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-02 16:30:00 UTC
- **Prompt ID**: 003
- **Topic**: High-Level Architecture Diagram Design with Iterative Refinements
- **Outcome**: Final architecture diagram (Mermaid format)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

---

## Context

After creating the OpenAPI specification, needed to design a visual architecture for the product management system that:
1. Handles 10k+ RPS throughput
2. Demonstrates advanced Node.js concepts (Worker Threads, Streams)
3. Implements event-driven workflows
4. Uses appropriate storage strategies (hot/cold)
5. Suitable for local development with LocalStack

**Design Goals:**
- Simplicity for demo project
- Realistic production-like architecture
- Clear data flow visualization
- Scalable design patterns

Human in the loop
```
we only need AuthN/Z (document approach only) so we can remove authentication 
for now and have a auth header that identifies the seller.
```
```
remove clustering and streams and just use worker threads to demonstrate 
advance node concepts
```
```
actually we need to have hot storage as dynamo db for the analytics data 
and later move it to cold storage s3
```
Add support for bulk CSV upload products using file streams, and show me 
the architecture.
```

**AI Response:**
Final architecture with:
- **Stream Pipeline**: Multer → CSV Parser → Batch Transform → DB Writer
- Worker Threads for analytics
- Complete hot/cold storage flow
- X-Seller-Id authentication

**Final Architecture Achieved:**
✅ Single Node.js API server
✅ Worker Threads (advanced concept #1)
✅ Streams (advanced concept #2)
✅ DynamoDB hot + S3 cold storage
✅ Event-driven with Kafka
✅ Real-time SSE notifications
