# AI Prompt 009: Backend Unit Testing Implementation with SSE Testing Fix

## User Prompt

Implement comprehensive unit testing for the TypeScript backend with full test coverage across all layers (middleware, routes, services) and fix the failing Server-Sent Events (SSE) test suite.

## Part 1: Comprehensive Unit Testing

**Objective:** Complete test suite for backend using Jest + TypeScript

**Test Structure:**
```
backend/__tests__/
├── middleware/ (auth, errorHandler, rateLimiter)
├── routes/ (products, events, health)
└── services/ (productService, csvImportService)
```

**Coverage:** Middleware, Routes, Services with proper mocking
**Goal:** >80% coverage across all metrics

## Part 2: SSE Testing Fix

**Problem Statement:**

Four tests in `backend/__tests__/routes/events.test.ts` are timing out:
- "should establish SSE connection"
- "should handle Redis subscription errors"
- "should send notifications to client"
- "should handle malformed notification messages"

**Root Cause:**

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a streaming protocol where:
- The HTTP connection remains open indefinitely
- Data is sent in chunks over time (not a complete response)
- The response never "ends" in the traditional HTTP sense

`supertest` is designed for request-response patterns:
- It waits for the response to complete (the `end` event)
- It buffers the entire response internally
- It cannot handle streaming responses that never complete
- Data event callbacks don't fire as expected

**Solution:** Migrate SSE tests from supertest to native Node.js `http.request()`

**Why?**
- Supertest buffers responses (doesn't support streaming)
- SSE requires real-time chunk handling
- Native http provides direct stream access

**Implementation:**
1. Use real HTTP server on random port
2. Handle streaming data chunks in real-time
3. Add `res.flush()` after `res.write()` in SSE endpoint
4. Proper connection lifecycle management

**Result:** 
- ✅ Keep supertest for REST endpoints
- ✅ Use native http for SSE/streaming


## Deliverables

**Test Suites:** 8 files covering middleware, routes, services
**Coverage:** >80% across all metrics (40+ tests)
**Tools:** Jest, ts-jest, supertest (REST), native http (SSE)

**Files Created:**
- Middleware: auth, errorHandler, rateLimiter
- Routes: products, health, events (SSE with native http)
- Services: productService, csvImportService

**Key Principles:** Isolation, mocking, high coverage, TypeScript safety
