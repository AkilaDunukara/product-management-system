# AI Prompt 012: Frontend Implementation with React and TypeScript

## Context

After implementing the backend API, notification service, and analytics service, the final step is to build a modern frontend application. This React-based UI provides product management capabilities with real-time notifications via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

**Architecture Requirements:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Real-time notifications via SSE
- CSV import functionality
- Responsive modern UI
- Environment-based configuration

---

## Part 1: Initial Setup and Configuration

### User Prompt

Set up a React + TypeScript frontend with Vite that includes:
1. Environment configuration for API endpoints and SSE
2. Type definitions for products, notifications, and API responses
3. Axios-based API service with interceptors
4. SSE connection management
5. Custom hooks for data fetching and real-time updates

### Implementation Summary

**Tech Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite

**Key Features:**
- Real-time notifications via SSE
- CSV import with progress tracking
- Product CRUD with filtering/pagination
- Custom hooks (useSSE, useProducts, useLocalStorage, useToast)
- Type-safe API service with axios
- Environment-based configuration
- Responsive design

**Components Created:** 8 components (LoginForm, ProductsTable, ProductModal, ImportPage, NotificationsPanel, AppLayout, AppHeader, Toast)

## Human in the Loop

**User Iterations:**
1. "Use custom hooks for reusability" → Created useSSE, useProducts, useLocalStorage, useToast
2. "Add .env file for environment variables" → Created .env.example with VITE_* variables
3. "Separate logic from App.tsx to individual components" → Refactored into modular components
4. "Fix type errors" → Added proper TypeScript types throughout
